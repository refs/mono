## Details

* Change - Add more default resolutions: [#23](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/23)

   The `ocis-thumbnails` service was also used by the mediaviewer but the returned images were
   too small since the highest resolution was 128x128 pixels.

* Change - Refactor code to remove code smells: [#21](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/21)

   Scanning the code using a static code analyzer showed some code smells. This change fixes them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/21


* Change - Use micro service error api: [#31](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/31)

   The service now also returns a status code when an error occurs.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/31


* Enhancement - Limit users to access own thumbnails: [#5](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/5)

   Users of the service can no longer request thumbnails of another users by guessing the etag. The
   thumbnails are now only accessible by the users who created the thumbnail.

# Changelog for [0.1.2] (2020-05-11)

## Summary

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix usage of context.Context: [#18](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/18)

   The context was filled with a key defined in the package service but read with a key from the
   package imgsource. Since `service.key` and `imgsource.key` are different types imgsource
   could not read the value provided by service.

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix execution when passing program flags: [#15](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/15)

   The program flags where not correctly recognized because we didn't pass them to the micro
   framework when initializing a grpc service.

## Summary

* Change - Initial release of basic version: [#1](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/1)
* Change - Use predefined resolutions for thumbnail generation: [#7](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/7)
* Change - Implement the first working version: [#3](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/pull/3)

## Details

* Change - Initial release of basic version: [#1](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/1)

   Just prepare an initial basic version to embed a thumbnailer into our microservice
   infrastructure in the scope of the ownCloud Infinite Scale project.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/1


* Change - Use predefined resolutions for thumbnail generation: [#7](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/7)

   We implemented predefined resolutions to prevent attacker from flooding the service with a
   large number of thumbnails. The requested resolution gets mapped to the closest matching
   predefined resolution.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/issues/7


* Change - Implement the first working version: [#3](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-thumbnails/pull/3)

   We implemented the first simple version. It can load images via webdav and store them locally in
   the filesystem.
